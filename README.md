# LODE

The Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE) is an exploratory project of the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL), at the Centre for Special Business Projects (CSBP), Statistics Canada. The project is currently in development.

For now, references to open data and their licensing are stored in the corresponding data type folders. OpenTabulate source files and scripts reside here as well, which are indicated by `opentab_*` subdirectories.

## Open data master list

`MasterList_OpenDataPortals.csv` is the master list of known official data portals (and other useful sources) along with their license information and whether they've been used in various databases. The list is put together from previously constructed open databses (such as the ODB) and can act as a starting frame for potential data sources to explore when creating a new open data theme.
