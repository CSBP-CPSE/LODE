# LODE

The Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE) is an exploratory project of the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL), at the Centre for Special Business Projects (CSBP), Statistics Canada. The project is currently in development.

For now, references to open data and their licensing are stored in the corresponding data type folders. OpenTabulate source files and scripts reside here as well, which are indicated by `opentab_*` subdirectories.
